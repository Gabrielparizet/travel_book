    <strong><ins>About:</ins></strong> Travel Book is a social network developed in a group of three from an already written code in PHP using MySQL and WAMP for database handling. Our goal as a team was to reformat the already written code in the firstplace and to improve it by adding other functionalities and features in a second time. <br>
    Travel Book is a social network centered of travel themes. The core idea of the project is to allow users to share their travel's experience through their posts.

    <strong><ins>Teamwork and organization:</ins></strong> Starting in pair-programming, we quickly moved to a task division using <strong>Trello</strong> and <strong>Git and GitHub</strong> for versioning.

    <strong><ins>My role:</ins></strong> In this project, I endorsed the role of a lead-developer for the first time, driving our workflow, ensuring everyone was motivated by the realization of our social network and making sure features were developed on time. It was a big challenge through which I improved many team-work communication and perseverance skills by helping my other classmates to achieve their goals.

    <strong><ins>Features:</ins></strong> Fully written in PHP which we were using for the first time, we implemented many social network related features, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Creating a user account, stocking the user's credentials in a database and handling user's session login and logout.
      </li>
      <li>
        Creating posts from a user account stocked in a relational database through a Post route taking the user's id into account.
      </li>
      <li>
        Associating posts to a Hashtag thanks to which we were able to get posts related to that particular Hashtag. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Adding the possibility to post a picture in a user's post with that picture being stocked in our server and its slug in our database, relating it to the post Id.
      <li>
        Handling likes for posts from a user account and stocking them in the database using the users' and posts' Ids. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Being able to follow other users from their profiles and displaying the number of following and followed users in the connected user's personal profile.
      </li>
      <li>
        Posting a profile picture with the same technique used for posts' pictures, stocking the picture's slug in our database relating it to the user's Id.
      </li>
    </ul>
